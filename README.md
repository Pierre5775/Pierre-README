An easy-to-use program that facilitates user's task to determine **loan**, **compound interest** and **capitalization**  It calculates a bond value, interest rate, period to pay-off, debt value paid on the bond, amount paid until today . 

***For Loan enter L , for Compound enter C , for Capitalization enter Cap***  
* V0 = Debt Value
* a  = Bond Value
* n  = Number of periods(annual ,monthly, others,...)
* i  = Annual percentage interest rate
  
**Must have one missing parameter and neither V0 , a, n or i can be a negative number unless it is the missing parameter that we are looking to determine**
<sub> calculation is determined under the following defintion* **def loan_calc(V0,a,n,i)** using the function  **(Matrix,V0,a,n,i) = loan_calc(V0,a,n,i)**
<sub> In the table Matrix the first[] reads horizontally and the second [] next to it reads vertically
 pas = 0.0025 is the distance between between i2 and i1 .
 <sub> In first line of the table Matrix[2][0] we get D1 that is the first loan payment
 <sub> D1 = a - V0 * i
